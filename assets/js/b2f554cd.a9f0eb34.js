Karimi, sem 4)\\n- Database Design (prof. Pirahesh, sem 5)\\n- Software Engineering (prof. Karimi, sem 5)\\n- Artificial Intelligence (prof. Khodayi, sem 5)\\n- Specific Topics: Social Network Analysis Using AI (prof. Khodayi, sem 5)\\n\\n## Testing Stuff Out\\n\\nI was a frontend developer with one year of experience at the time I started developing Luna.\\nBut boy, I loved developing software,\\nso I was trying to find a way to think about systems design,\\nwrite backend code,\\ntry new frontend frameworks out (there are literally new frameworks out every week in the JS community,\\nisn\'t that just cool?),\\nget familiar with AI,\\nand grow some vegetation in GitHub.\\n\\nThe best way was starting my own project because no one uses `PWA`s or `Qwik` here in Iran because every company is so busy surviving the economic crisis they miss the real point of software development which is having fun using the latest and shiniest tools out there in the wild and then `shift+del`ing the project because these tools are no longer supported :(\\nSorrowful indeed.\\n\\n### PWA\\n\\nInstalling applications to your gramps\' laptop, right from the browser, and unbelievably from the same codebase? No way! I had to test that out.\\n\\n### Web assembly\\n\\nIn fact, there was no valid use case for `WASM` in this project,\\nbut I wanted to still do it anyway just because my friend is a `WASM` hater.\\n\\n### Qwik\\n\\nGod this is just so awesome. Using a framework which doesn\'t have libraries, community or code examples is just so fun. \\\\*Cries in O(1) Javascript execution.\\n\\n:::note\\nI am really ashamed to say this, but later I decided to use `Nextjs` instead of `Qwik`.\\n:::\\n\\n### Backend development with Golang\\n\\nThe Frontend realm is cool, but it really doesn\'t feel powerful.\\nEverything happens on the server.\\nOne server application instance serves millions of users, but the client is just for one user.\\n\\nSo in frontend, you don\'t face the challenges that become visible only when your request counts grow.\\nYou have to implement your software with engineering stuff in mind so your servers don\'t go brr.\\nIt definitely involves more software engineering concerns.\\n\\nYou have to think about security.\\nYou have to think about services and API design and lots of other cool things which I didn\'t know anything about them,\\nbut I am eager to take a look and get dirty.\\n\\n### CLI development\\n\\nI had created some toy CLI projects, but I wanted to create something useful,\\nso I decided to develop a terminal client for Luna with limited features.\\n\\n## Possible Future Side-Hustle\\n\\nClassic capitalism using marketplaces.\\nIf I sold project management panacea for 5 dollars, wouldn\'t everybody be willing to purchase it?\ud83d\ude08"}]}')}}]);
