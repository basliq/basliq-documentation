In this blog post I am going to explain why I created `luna`.

<!--truncate-->

## The Real Reason

I like **challenges**. That's it. I wanted to create a functioning software from the scratch that people could actually use and benefit from it. I wanted to prove to myself that I am capable.

## Helping People Out

I wanted to use my abilities to help people. I mean we code everyday but some of us can't see the direct impact of our pull-requests on the clients and customers, can we? I really wanted to create a piece of software that people actually use and say this really helped me out, kudos to whoever made this possible. In this situation, that feeling that you have been useful to the humanity is just sweet.

## Getting a Job

## Merging University Projects

When I started thinking about this project (2023-09-12), I was a CE student in `Azad university: Tabriz branch` and as a student I had to work on assignments and projects for each course.

So I said to myself, _what would happen if instead of doing 10 meaningless small projects I did this one big project_?

To which I responded with _hmmmm, that's actually not a bad idea_. I talked with my professors to see if they approve this idea and they did and here we are.

List of courses that helped Luna grow into the beautiful software that she is now:

- System analysis and design (prof. Karimi)
- Database Design (prof. Pirahesh)
- Software Engineering (prof. Karimi)
