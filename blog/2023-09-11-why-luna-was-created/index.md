In this blog post I am going to explain why I created `luna`.

<!--truncate-->

## The Real Reason

I like **challenges**. That was the main reason why I started this project. I wanted to create a fully functioning software from the scratch that people could actually use and benefit from it. I wanted to prove to myself that I am capable.

## Helping People Out

I wanted to use my abilities to help people. I mean we code everyday but some of us can't see the direct impact of our pull-requests on the clients and customers, can we? I really wanted to create a piece of software that people could actually use and say this really helped me out, kudos to whoever made this possible. In this situation, that feeling that you have been useful to the humanity is just sweet.

## Getting a Job

This is a whole another story which I don't like to bring up here.

## Merging University Projects

When I started thinking about this project (2023-09-12), I was a CE student in `Azad university: Tabriz branch` and as a student I had to work on assignments and projects for each course.

So I said to myself, _what would happen if instead of doing 10 meaningless small projects I did this one big project_?

To which I responded with _hmmmm, that's actually not a bad idea_. I talked with my professors to see if they approve this idea which they did and here we are.

List of courses that helped Luna grow into the beautiful software that she is now:

- System analysis and design (prof. Karimi)
- Database Design (prof. Pirahesh)
- Software Engineering (prof. Karimi)

## Testing Stuff Out

I was a frontend developer with one year of experience at the time I started developing Luna. But boy, I loved developing software so I was trying to find a way to think about systems design, write backend code, try new frontend frameworks out (there are literally new frameworks out every week in the JS community, isn't that just cool?) and grow some vegetation in the github.

The best way was starting my own project because no one uses PWAs or Qwik here in Iran because every company is so busy surviving the economical crisis they miss the real point of software development which is having fun using the latest and shiniest tools out there in the wild and then `shift+del`ing the project because these tools are no longer supported :( Very sad indeed.

### PWA

Installing applications to your gramps' laptop, right from the browser, and unbelievably from the same codebase? No way! I had to test that out.

### Web assembly

In fact there was no valid use case for WASM in this project but I wanted to still do it anyway just because my friend is a WASM hater.

### Qwik

God this is just so awesome. Using a framework which doesn't have libraries, community or code examples is just so fun. \*Cries in O(1) Javascript execution.

### Backend development with Golang

Frontend realm is cool but it really doesn't feel powerful. Everything happens on the server. One server application instance servers millions of users but client is just for one user.

So in frontend, you don't face the challenges that become visible only when your request counts grow. You have to implement your software with engineering stuff in mind so your servers don't go brrr. It definitely involves more software engineering concerns.

You have to think about security. You have to think about services and API design and lots of other cool things which I didn't know anything about them but I was wager to take a look and get dirty.

### CLI development

I had created some toy CLI projects but I wanted to create something useful so I decided to develop a terminal client for Luna with limited features.
