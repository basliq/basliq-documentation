# System Vision Document

The starting point to engineering discussions.

## Problem Description

There are countless project/task management tools in the marketplace,
and some of them have over millions of users.
Each one of these applications offer lots of features, but they still miss some key ones.  

Some of these applications have a very complex user interface which is not suitable for a small startup.
Some have intuitive user interfaces but are unable to provide extra features if needed.  

Most applications also don't use AI as a tool to help project managers to quickly analyze their projects.
AI could also help with generating tasks, writing descriptions and taking commands from the user.  

Some applications don't provide a way to communicate with other teammates inside the app
and delegate these tasks to other 3rd party applications.


## What Basliq Could Bring to the Table?

Basliq is capable of:
- Providing a smooth experience to project managers and other collaborators 
- Functioning as a complete offline application for individuals with __no desire to store their information on the cloud__

:::info
In this scenario the application will store its data on the local machine
and won't be available in the cloud so other devices won't have access to it. 
:::

- Approaching edits as __offline-first__ so team members can work offline and then sync their edits when internet connection is available
- Helping managers with __powerful reports__ gathered from workspaces, boards, tasks, members' activities and comments and analyzed by __Basliq AI__
- Enabling in-app communications with Basliq's __in-app chat application__
- Providing mostly open-source codebase, and __mostly free online services__ with cheap extra features
- Expanding its UI and adding features to it as the managers feel the need for it

:::info
In the future Basliq might have an option to enable superpowers!
Initially,
the UI will start simple, but in the application settings you will be able to enable extra features.
This is beneficial for small teams as they won't need lots of extra and unused features,
so a cleaner UI will make them more productive.
Larger organizations can opt in to more complex application later.
:::

- Supercharging by integrating with your favorite __3rd party tools__


## Target Audience

Basliq is going to be a simple and general-purpose project management tool with a slight orientation towards software development needs and use cases.
The following is a list of most important targets: 

- Small software development teams
- Individual software developers
- Other small teams and individuals
