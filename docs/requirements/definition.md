# Project Definition

Basliq is a project-management tool that tries to solve some overlooked issues in the project-management world. 
In this section, we first take a look at the existing problems and how Basliq aims to solve those issues.
Then we make a rough estimation of who our users will be.

## Problems
This section lists a set of major problems that Basliq tries to solve them.

### National Businesses Are Facing Issues
Many project/task management tools are __unavailable__ in __Iran__.
They either ban the user from accessing their services completely or partially providing them.
The other problem occurs when trying to manage a project that has many participants
because most tools require the users to subscribe to their paid services when a team gets big enough.
International monetary transactions are very difficult to do in Iran
and to make things worse the companies often don’t provide a PPP.  

### Who Gets to Own the Data?
There is indeed a wide variety of business models for project management tools
but most popular ones only offer online services so your data resides in their services.
This is not a concern for many organizations but __some prefer to keep their sensitive data in their servers__.  

### Offline Support Is a Must
In today’s world, we take free instant internet access for granted but this is not the case.
Many places don’t have high-speed internet connections, some have no internet connection for some time,
and some individuals just want to be able to use the application without connectivity.

### Good-looking User Interfaces Have Become Rare
A useful and eye-catching user interface is often overlooked in the software industry.
Great project management experience requires a great UI.


## What Basliq Brings to the Table?

Basliq is capable of:
- Providing a smooth experience to project managers and other collaborators 
- Functioning as a complete offline application for individuals with __no desire to store their information on the cloud__

:::info
In this scenario the application will store its data on the local machine
and won't be available in the cloud so other devices won't have access to it. 
:::

- Approaching edits as __offline-first__ so team members can work offline and then sync their edits when internet connection is available
- Helping managers with __powerful reports__ gathered from workspaces, boards, tasks, members' activities and comments and analyzed by __Basliq AI__
- Enabling in-app communications with Basliq's __in-app chat application__
- Providing mostly open-source codebase, and __mostly free online services__ with cheap extra features
- Expanding its UI and adding features to it as the managers feel the need for it

:::info
In the future Basliq might have an option to enable superpowers!
Initially,
the UI will start simple, but in the application settings you will be able to enable extra features.
This is beneficial for small teams as they won't need lots of extra and unused features,
so a cleaner UI will make them more productive.
Larger organizations can opt in to more complex application later.

- Supercharging by integrating with your favorite __3rd party tools__


## Target Audience

As seen from the goals and characteristics of Basliq,
it can be concluded that our estimated target audience groups are but not limited to:

- Iranian businesses and others that face the same issues
- Individuals or small startup teams that need a free and powerful solution to their needs
- Individuals who need offline software
