# Requirements
In this section the discussion will be about the features and services that luna will provide. To do so we have to look at what other applications are offering to their users in more detail and extract the strong and useful characteristics and avoid weak points. Then we will talk about Luna's requirements.

## Researching Vendor Solutions
Each application below has millions of users. The reason for this is that each one is offering something unique and special that others don't. Each one solves a distinct problem.
We intend to learn what each application does best and learn from them.

### Primavera
Todo.

### Jira
Todo.

### MS project
Todo.

### Monday

### Basecamp
Basecamp focuses heavily on communication. There are comments everywhere including files and tasks. There is a message board where important announcements get posted. It also has private and public non-work chats.

This project management tool also supports file versioning and real-time notifications.

Basecamp also looks a bit outdated and UI doesn't really look modern but no one can deny its intuitive and easy-to-use design.

### Github projects
Github projects is a built-in tool for Github repositories. You can create issues for your repositories, refer to other issues, pull requests and users in there. You can add labels and milestones (similar to deadlines) too. In the project you can create a Kanban board or view your issues as a list.

Comment and reply mechanism provided for issues and pull-requests alongside discussions, forums and wikis result in a powerful environment for communication and knowledge sharing.

Overall it is a simple yet powerful tool alongside your code repository to perform task management right there.

### Asana
Asana is an easy-to-use tool which attracts lots of people just with its intuitive UI. It has all the essential features like creating a ticket, assigning it to a person (but not multiple), viewing the project in 4 different views of Gantt chart, Kanban board, Calendar and list view. It also supports a set of workflows.
