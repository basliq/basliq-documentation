# Project Definition

Introduction to engineering documentation. In this section we are going to discuss the general topics about the project.

## Objectives

We are pursuing some objectives and hoping to accomplish them:
1. We want everyone to have access to a free and standard project management tool. Individuals and small teams who have just started their businesses should not put a budget aside for just a project management tool.
2. Some people don't have a great internet connection or none at all. We have been there.
    - We provide support for **syncs**. That means you can still work with Luna if your internet is down and Luna will sync all your data when your internet comes back online.
    - You can also install the Luna application on your machine and that means you can work offline. Great for **individuals** who don't have an internet connection.
3. Luna is intended to have a **minimalistic** and **intuitive** UI initially. That means Luna won't be able to support lots of features since most users won't need them.

In the future Luna might have an option to enable superpowers! Initially the UI will start simple but in the application settings you will be able to enable extra features. This is beneficial for small teams as they won't need lots of extra and unused features so a cleaner UI will make them more productive. Larger organizations can opt in to more complex application later.

## Target Audience

Luna is going to be a simple and general-purpose project management tool with a slight orientation towards software development needs and use cases.
The following is a list of most important targets: (closer to top, more important target) 

- Small development teams
- Developer individuals
- Other small teams and individuals
- Large organizations
